    <b> <p class="oddPara">It was summer. A crow was very thirsty. He flew here and there in search of water.<br> Suddenly he saw a pitcher. There was a little water at the bottom of the pitcher. The crow tried to drink the water but could not drink it.<br> He then tried to overturn the pitcher but failed again. He saw some pebbles nearby. At last the crow hit upon a plan.<br> He picked them up and dropped one by one into the pitcher.The water soon rose up to the brim.<br> The crow drank water to its heart’s content. In this way he quenched his thirst and flew away happily.</p>
